## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Component discovery via entry points
The system SHALL support entry point discovery for pluggable components via per-interface managers (Validator/Memory/ModelAdapter/Tool/Skill/MCPClient/Hook/ConfigProvider/PromptStore). Each manager SHALL inherit BaseComponentManager and return an ordered list of its managed components when provided an IConfigProvider.

#### Scenario: Validator manager discovery
- **WHEN** ValidatorManager loads entry points
- **THEN** it MUST return a list of IValidator ordered by ascending IComponent.order

#### Scenario: Memory manager discovery
- **WHEN** MemoryManager loads entry points with an IConfigProvider
- **THEN** it MUST initialize and register IMemory components and return the ordered list

### Requirement: Ordered registration
The system SHALL order discovered components by ascending `order` value before initialization and registration.

#### Scenario: Order determines precedence
- **WHEN** two components are discovered with `order` values of 10 and 50
- **THEN** the component with order 10 MUST initialize and register first
